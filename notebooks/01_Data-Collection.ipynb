    "\n",
    "This tool will estimate the affluence of a neighborhood based on the number of $ of businesses and services (according to Yelp) in a given neighborhood. ($, $$, $$$) This tool will expect to get, as an input, a list of zip codes or names of neighborhoods and will estimate the wealth of the locality. While traditional methods typically estimate wealth of a locality based on demographic characteristics (e.g. income or unemployment rate), the novelty of this approach is in its use of big data related to commercial activity and cost of product and services as an indicator for affluency.\n"
